Unlike regular notes, this doesn't automatically save itself.*\n\n## Basic formatting\n\nParagraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.\n\nParagraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of *italics* and **bold** is supported. This *can be **nested** like* so.\n\n## Lists\n\n### Ordered list\n\n1. Item 1\n2. A second item\n3. Number 3\n4.IV\n\n\nNote: the next list will be unordered.\n\n### Unordered list\n\n* An item\n* Another item\n* Yet another item\n* And there's more...\n\n\n---\n\n## Headings\n\nThere are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You've probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.\n\n### Headings *can* also contain **formatting**\n\n### They can even contain `inline code`\n\nOf course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.\n\nI don't recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you're smallest heading isn't too small, and you're largest heading isn't too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.\n\n--\n\n## URLs\n\nURLs can be made in a handful of ways:\n\n* A named link to [MarkItDown][3]. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit `Ctrl+L`.\n* Another named link to [MarkItDown](http://www.markitdown.net/)\n* Sometimes you just want a URL like <http://www.markitdown.net/>."
